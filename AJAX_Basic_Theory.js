// Basic Theory

// AJAX : "Asynchorous Javascript and XML"

// HTTP request (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) Means it is the way and  method  to communicate between client and server 

// is a set of "web development techniques "
// using many web technologies on the "client-side"
// To create asynchorous web applications 


// With AJAX, web application can send and retrieve
// data from a server asynchorous (in the background)
// without interfering with the display and
// behaviour of the existing page

// We don't use data in XML format anymore
// we use JSON now.


// We have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
// 1. XMLHTTPRequest(XHR) (old way of doing)
// 2. fetch API (new way of doing)
// 3. axios (this is third party library)
